# üöÄ Quick Deploy Guide - Get Your App Online in 5 Minutes

## What You Need to Share with Students

**NOT the GitHub repository URL** - Students need the **live app URL**

## Fastest Method: Vercel

### Step 1: Build Your App
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist` folder with your app.

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with email or GitHub
3. Click "Add New" ‚Üí "Project"
4. Drag your `dist` folder onto the page
5. Click "Deploy"
6. **Copy the URL they give you** (like: https://your-app-abc123.vercel.app)

### Step 3: Share with Students
**Give students this URL:** https://your-app-abc123.vercel.app

**Login credentials:**
- Students: student1@school.com, student2@school.com, etc.
- Teacher: admin@school.com
- Password: anything works

## Alternative: Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag `dist` folder to deploy area
3. Get your URL
4. Share with students

## Alternative: GitHub Pages (Free)

2. Create new repository: "eduai-app"
3. Upload all your files
4. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
5. Enable GitHub Pages
6. Get URL: https://username.github.io/eduai-app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The app works on phones, tablets, and computers
